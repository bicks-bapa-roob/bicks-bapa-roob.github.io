By now you must be wondering, what the heck is **"Bicks-bapa-roob"**?

One evening, our founding members were on their usual weekly lunch catch-up call and as I recall, one of the members was sick. It prompted another one of our members to tell a story from his childhood. 

He recounted that as a little kid, his mother would always rub this clear-looking cream on his face and upper body. The cream supposedly helped open up the nasal cavities and promoted breathing when he had a stuffy nose. The name of the product was, you guessed it, bicks-bapa-roob.

A few years later, he was developing a stuffy nose while at a friend's house for a sleepover. Naturally, he asked the friend if he had any of the good stuff to help with his breathing. The friend looked at him as though he was crazy, and said he wasn't sure and had never heard of such a product. The friend asked his dad if they had any and he was basically like, "wtf". A few minutes go by and the friend's mom comes down saying they didn't have any bicks-bapa-roob, but that they had this rub that was supposedly good for this sort of thing. VaporRub. By Vicks. Vicks. VaporRub. Bicks Bapa Roob.

It was at THAT moment, that he realized he had been duped by his mother's Mexican accent. The worst part, however, was that his father - who was born and raised in Vancouver, BC - was intentionally mispronouncing it.

The group chuckled over the story, and a legend was born.
